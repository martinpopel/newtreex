to be tested:

file format:
- roundtrip (stored file identical with input)
- survive crlf ?
- special unicode symbols
- catch fatal errors in input data (loops, invalid encoding, empty
fields)
- strict validation during reading possible (but not by default)

node manipulation:
- delete node (incl. nonproj descendants)
- add node
- reorder (shift before,after)
- catch set_parent leading to a loop
- split a node into two node
- inserting/deleting a bundle in the middle
- inserting/deleting trees in a bundle

size
- very long lemmas (>64k)
- very wide trees (>1k nodes)
- very many comment lines

universal features
- layered features
- unknown features
- multiple values (separated by comma)
- alphabetically ordered (ignore case) features and values
 (valid in the output, warning if invalid in the input)

- api for coordinations

- api for multiword tokens

- memory leaks

- tests of command-line execution (treex/bin/t/treexrun.t)
